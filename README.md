# Deprecated!
This project is deprecated! I am no longer maintaining this project. Why not check out [Metallic](https://github.com/Metallic-Web/Metallic)?

I have a mostly finished project like Nightmare that I might release when I feel like it. Stay Tuned!

# Nightmare
Nightmare is a virtual operating system that runs online, designed to bypass censorship and includes many apps like a notepad and a html editor.

## Beta
### Notes
- Some apps, icons and content are placeholders
- Not all apps have been added
- There will be bugs and unstable content
- Making a version with a server that will have a proxy and more features
### Bugs
- Cannot open multiple `js` apps
- Resizing the right side of a window before it is moved it weird
- Sometimes jQuery does not load

## Apps
More info can be found in `apps.json`
